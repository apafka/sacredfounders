    <p>Sacred Founders is a private, vetted community for founders seeking spirituality / source.</p>
    <p>My mission is to guide you back to the source and your own unique truth with with the help of power plants like cannabis and psilocybin.</p>

      <h2>Sacred Founders Podcast</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgkGOIypNes">This is our podcast Introduction</a> where we talk to other founders about life, spirituality, energy, well being and entrepreneurship.</p>

    <h2 id="aboutus">About Us</h2>
    <p>This will be my life's work. No hurry, no pause. I'm starting this for myself to grow a community. It’s just me and my family with an accumulated 40 years of experience with plant medicines and spirituality. Kind of similar to Benjamin Franklin's Junto. I can vibe with your vibe.</p> 

    <h2 id="membership">Membership</h2>
    <p>Every Sacred Founders applicant is interviewed, vetted, and researched before they’re invited. We will only accept a compatible vibe match into our community. The price for a yearly membership is currently undecided. Email <b>pafka@hey.com</b>for more information.</p>

    <h2 id="Mission">Mission</h2>
    <p>My mission is to help plants as tools to connect yourself to nature and your heart. Cannabis, psilocybin mushroom and indigenous tobacco snuff are power plants that I specialize in.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p> My vision with this is to gather a group of like-minded individuals who connect and grow together with the help of plants. Have our own resort at a vibrant location. Grow our own medicine and food. Focus on sports like MMA, calisthenics, yoga and surfing. Guide other fellow entrepreneurs around campfires and hold space for healing and clearing. And share all of this together with my family and other individuals and families with children.</p> 

     <h2 id="why">Why</h2>
    <p>I'm doing this because I find it geniuinely fun and exciting to play the guitar around a campfire with some plants. As well as moving energy and ascending. Why these plants? I prefer them, know them and have long experience. And honestly these are the ones that I enjoy the most. I just know this game and I would be happy to enlighten you. It's my lifestyle together with my family. We value this connection to nature, to the heart and to the universe.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_96TrgFflg&feature=youtu.be">This is the type of music we jam to</a>. In the future would be great to include my wife and kids into our band with drums and maracas.</p>

    <h2 id="signals">Read my story</h2>
    <p> I started as a spoiled and repressed mama's boy that was suicidal by 20. After finding plant medicines and  guides, I healed and went to start a family with my childhood crush, lived with 100 year old shamans in the rainforest, had spiritual initiations, climbed Chinggis Khans’s mountain to pursue my roots and experienced enlightenment. And I've faced my struggles during ascension like lack of a supportive group.
